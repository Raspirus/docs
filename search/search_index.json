Antivirus applications often scan the entire process tree of an executable to identify malware. However, Raspirus is designed differently. It is a lightweight, on-demand file scanner optimized for low-end devices like the Raspberry Pi.</p> <p>Raspirus now leverages the power of the <code>yara-x</code> crate and Yara rules for its malware detection. Instead of relying on file signatures, Raspirus uses a flexible and powerful rule-based approach, scanning files for patterns and characteristics that match known malware behaviors. Yara rules are stored in a dedicated repository here, and these rules are regularly updated to ensure broader and more accurate malware detection.</p> <p>There are no restrictions on the type or size of files you can scan with Raspirus.</p>"},{"location":"scanning/#disadvantages","title":"Disadvantages","text":"<p>While the shift to Yara rules improves detection capabilities, there are still some limitations:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Rule Complexity: Writing and maintaining Yara rules can be complex.

This allows for a more robust defense against various malware types.</p> </li> <li> <p>Efficiency: Although Yara rules are more resource-intensive than signature matching, Raspirus remains optimized for low-resource devices like Raspberry Pi, providing fast and efficient scans without overwhelming system resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Offline Capability: Once the Yara rule database is downloaded and updated, Raspirus continues to function offline, maintaining the convenience of offline scanning.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Raspirus no longer uses pure signature matching due to its limitations in detecting modified or new malware. Instead, it provides a more comprehensive scanning solution while still remaining lightweight. However, like any security tool, it is not intended to replace a full-fledged antivirus application.
