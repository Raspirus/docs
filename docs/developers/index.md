# Developers

The Raspirus project mainly uses two different programming languages and frameworks. 
One for the backend and one for the backend and one for the frontend. \
The frontend is written in JavaScript using the [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) framework.
The backend on the other side is written in Rust. The communication between these two programming languages is
made using the [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) framework. Using this framework one can write functions in Rust and
call them from the frontend easily.
