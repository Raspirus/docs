# Frontend

## Planing
The planing of the Raspirus frontend happened on an external Website called Figma. The styling changed a bit and there are some more functions now, but the logical structure is roughly the same. Each screen you see is a single page on Next.js. Furthermore the pop-ups have been replaced with ones from SweetAlertv2. You can explore the Figma project in the iFrame below, else if nothing is showing up, you can look at the project [here](https://www.figma.com/file/pkgpwieNbhYiOi4Gz6Uyt6/Raspirus).
