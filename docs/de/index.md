## Willkommen bei Raspirus Docs
Welcome to the Raspirus docs. Here you will find everything you might need touse the app or build it yourself. The app is not very complex to use and the UI is very intuitive, but sometimes you might just want to read about certain functions, and this is a great place to start. Underneath almost all pages there is always a dedicated Comments section where you can write a comment and/or ask for help. You will need a GitHub account for that, because the comments are synchronized with the GitHub repository [discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/Raspirus/discussions).

## Something missing?
If you have any suggestions about features, or think that something is missing in the documentation, you can either write a comment below the page or open an issue. If you decide to open an issue or request a feature, please do so by using GitHub.
