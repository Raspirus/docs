# Contributions
This project is entirely open-source and wouldn't be possible without your help. Every contribution even if just a little can help a lot. Opening an issue if you find a bug, fixing the bug by opening a pull-request, adding translations, adding features and much more are all types of contributions that help the project go forward.

## Translations
The app itself is made with user-friendliness in mind and therefore doesn't have much text to translate as we want the experience to be fast without slowing down the user by forcing him/her to read lots of stuff. Nonetheless, this project still needs a lot of translators. Foremost we need translators for the docs that you are reading right now, but the app also needs translators. Translations help improve the user experience and make the project more widely available. You can find out more on the [dedicated page](./translations.md).

## Coding
The app is built using mainly two programming languages: Rust and JavaScript. JavaScript is used for the frontend to build a website using the [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) framework and make the app look nicer and be cross-platform. The backend on the other side is written in Rust because we value speed a lot when scanning files and therefore need a fast language. To make the two communicate we use the Tauri framework. [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is an open-source framework written in Rust, quite new in its field. In future there is also a plan to add a Python installer. If you have knowledge in any of these fields you are more than welcome to contribute to the project. You can obviously also use this project as an example to create your own project.
