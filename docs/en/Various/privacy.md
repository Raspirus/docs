# Privacy and Data Collection

Thank you for using Raspirus, an open-source malware scanner. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding how your data is handled. Please read the following information to understand our practices:

## Data Collection

Raspirus does not collect or store any personal data from its users. The application operates entirely offline, and all data processed by Raspirus remains local to your device. We do not track your usage patterns, IP addresses, or any other identifying information.

### Logging

Raspirus may generate logs as part of its normal operation to aid in diagnosing technical issues or debugging the application. These logs are stored locally on your device and never transmitted to us automatically. You, as the user, have full control over these logs and can choose to share them with us manually if seeking assistance or reporting a problem.

### External Connections

The only external connection Raspirus makes is during the process of updating its malware definition database. This connection is necessary to download the latest updates from GitHub, our chosen repository for maintaining these definitions. Please be aware that during this update process, GitHub may collect data as per its own privacy policies, over which we have no control.

## User Control and Consent

We do not collect any data from you unless explicitly provided by you (such as voluntarily sharing logs). Your usage of Raspirus is entirely anonymous and private by design. We respect your privacy and are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of any information you choose to share with us.

## Future Commitment

Raspirus is and will remain privacy-friendly. We do not foresee any changes to our policy of not collecting user data in the future. We have no interest in your personal data, and we will never compromise your trust by collecting it.

## Contact Us
