# CONTRIBUTING

## Enhance the Codebase

As a developer looking to amplify Raspirus's functionality, your contributions are invaluable. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Check Existing Issues:** Before diving in, peruse existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. If none exist, feel free to open a new one.
- **Documentation is Key:** Always ensure your code is well-documented. Remember to adapt tests to maintain code integrity.

## Enrich the Documentation

Raspirus's documentation is crafted using Markdown and powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) and Python. To contribute to the documentation:

- **Follow the Guide:** To begin, set up the documentation on your local machine by following the [guide](https://raspirus.github.io/docs/guides).
- **Material Theme:** Our documentation utilizes the Material Theme, which extends Markdown functionality. Discover more about it [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference).

## Drive Translations

Our documentation is multilingual thanks to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/raspirus), an intuitive external service. GUI translations are handled via JSON files. Refer to the [guide](https://raspirus.github.io/docs/guides) for comprehensive insights.

## Infuse Artwork and Media

The repository for artwork (logos, banners, etc.) and media (powerpoints, articles, graphs, etc.) is hosted separately at [this repository](https://github.com/Raspirus/media). Feel free to contribute and bolster our visual presence. Note that the current logo and banner were AI-generated due to the lack of artistic expertise.
