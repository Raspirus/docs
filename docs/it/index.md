## Introduction  

Raspirus is a lightweight, rules-based malware scanner designed for scanning files and directories. Originally developed to scan USB drives using a Raspberry Pi, it has since expanded to support local file and folder scanning on multiple platforms.  

Raspirus utilizes YARA-based detection rules to identify potential threats, offering a flexible and privacy-conscious approach to malware scanning. It supports scanning compressed files, ensuring thorough analysis. The project is community-supported and operates without cost, relying on donations.  

Designed for efficiency and ease of use, Raspirus provides a modern interface while maintaining fast and reliable scanning performance.
