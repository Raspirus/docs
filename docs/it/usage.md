# Utilizzo
The app itself is really easy to use. You don't need to configure anything, and can just open the app, choose the directory to scan and click the start button. Raspirus will take care of everything else. But sometimes you want to have some more specific settings, and that's where this small tutorial comes into play. Here you will find a small tutorial on how to use the app and what each settings does. Furthermore there will also be a dedicated section for diagrams to show how the app works internally, in case you are curious.
